# Installing Puffing Billy:

# 0. Check spec/support dir is auto-required in spec/rails_helper.rb.
#
# 1. Puffing Billy depends on Capybara. Install Capybara as explained
#    in spec/support/capybara.rb
#
# 2. Add puffing-billy to Gemfile:
#
# group :development, :test do
#   gem 'puffing-billy'
# end
#
# 3. Create a file like this one you're reading in spec/support/puffing_billy.rb.
require 'billy/rspec'

# 4. Copy the files in spec/support/ named below into your project:
require_relative 'http_record'
require_relative 'puffing_billy_extensions'

# 5. Configure cache to behave as required. See all available options at:
#    https://github.com/oesmith/puffing-billy#caching

# Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit_billy
# Capybara.javascript_driver = :poltergeist_billy

# 7. Start using Puffing Billy. See spec/features/share_page_spec.rb and
#    spec/features/user_upgrades_spec.rb for sample usage,
#    and find your cached responses in spec/support/http_cache/browser
